    <h1 class="text-center">Who we are.</h1>
    <p class="lead text-dark"> Our story begins in 1995 - a story not so different from many other entrepreneurs and
        dreamers. At the time,
        finding great tasting, fresh roasted coffee was surprisingly elusive. So, Doug Zell and Emily Mange decided to
        do something about it. They didn’t set out to change the world, just a small corner of it.
        Relocating from San Francisco, they opened their own coffee bar and retail store in Chicago’s eclectic Lakeview
        neighborhood. Roasting their coffee in-store, with equipment that was more antique than state-of-the-art, they
        honed their craft, seeking nothing less than perfection in every aspect of the experience. Little did Doug and
        Emily know that what started as a way to connect with people and the community in an intimate, personal way
        would blossom into something that would help shape an entire industry
    </p>
    <h1 class="text-center">Amazon Coffee Today</h1>
    <p class="lead text-dark"> Fast forward 22 years, and Intelligentsia still holds true to the values that have
        inspired us since day one. We’ve grown, we’ve evolved, but we certainly haven’t changed. Through our coffeebars,
        Roasting Works, and training labs, we now make our home in six quintessential American cities, each possessing
        distinctive characteristics that resonate within the Intelligentsia brand.

        From Chicago, we inherit the Midwestern work ethic and pragmatism that embodies the city of Big Shoulders. Los
        Angeles inspires us to dream big. New York reminds us of the need to be authentic and to live up to our own
        lofty expectations. Atlanta’s unmistakable Southern charm creates a model for our commitment to service.
        Cosmopolitan San Francisco fuels our continual push for innovation. And Boston reminds us to never abandon the
        revolution. Alone, each of these attributes is formidable. Combined they define our commitment to sourcing,
        developing, roasting, and distributing the world’s finest coffees.
    </p>
    <h1 class="text-center">Why We’re Different</h1>
    <p class="lead text-dark">We didn’t adopt Direct Trade practices because it’s a trendy way to do business; we
        introduced the concept to the coffee industry. Our commitment to direct trade allows us to cut out unnecessary
        importers and exporters, and enables us to truly partner with our growers.

        Our buying team travels the globe and is collectively in the field virtually every day of the year, sourcing new
        grower relationships and working with our existing farmers.

        We meticulously collect data, insights, and best practices from all of our growing partners and share them to
        improve overall quality. We also tie adherence to sustainable farming and environmental practices with our
        commitment to paying above Fair Trade prices for truly outstanding coffee. This ensures responsible stewardship
        of the land, and a sustainable business model for our farmers, resulting in partnerships that thrive year after
        year. Because of this, we’re able to provide you with exclusive, remarkable coffees you won’t find anywhere
        else.</p>
